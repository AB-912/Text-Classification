# TEXT CLASSIFICATION OF IMDB DATASET AVALIABLE ON TENSORFLOW

In this project, I implemented a text classification model using TensorFlow on the IMDB dataset. First, I verified the availability of necessary libraries and checked the functioning of GPU for faster computations.Next, I loaded the IMDB dataset from TensorFlow and split it into training, validation, and test sets. To build the model, I used a pre-trained text embedding model from TensorFlow, and added 16 layers with relu activation function. The final layer used the sigmoid function to classify the text as either positive or negative. For optimization, I used the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.After training the model, I tested it on an unseen dataset, and achieved an accuracy of 85%. This project allowed me to develop skills in natural language processing, deep learning, and data analysis using TensorFlow.Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to build and implement machine learning models for text classification tasks. I am excited to continue exploring the field of deep learning and applying these skills to real-world problems.
